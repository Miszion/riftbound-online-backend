# Riftbound Core Rules Riftbound Core Rules Last Updated: 2025-12-01 000. Golden and Silver Rules 001. Golden Rule 002. Card text supersedes rules text. W henever a card fundam entally contradicts the rules, the card's indication is w hat is true. 050. Silver Rule 051. Card text uses different term inology than rules. Card text should be interpreted according to these rules, not as though it w ere text w ithin these rules. 052. Card , w hen w ritten in card effects, is shorthand for " Main Deck card." Runes, legends, and battleﬁelds are not considered cards w hen executing the abilities and effects of gam e objects. They are considered cards for the purposes of these rules. 053. Cards refer to them selves in the ﬁrst person. 053.1. * Units and legends say "I," "m e," etc. 053.2. * Gear and spells say "this." 053.3. * Battleﬁelds say "here." 054. “Can’t beats Can” 054.1. Cards that forbid actions or effects, as a broad m ethod of determ ination, supersede cards that allow or perm it that sam e action or effect. 055. W hen executing card text, do as m uch as you can, ignoring im possible instructions. 055.1. If all of a card’s instructions are im possible, it is still played and resolved, but nothing happens. 100. Game Concepts 101. Deck Construction 102. Riftbound is a Trading Card Gam e w here a player m ust provide their ow n cards to play against other players. 103. To play Riftbound , a player m ust have tw o Decks, a Cham pion Legend , and a num ber of Battleﬁelds determ ined by the Mode of Play. 103.1. 1 Cham pion Legend 103.1.a. This is placed in the Legend Zone at the start of the gam e. 103.1.b. This w ill dictate the Dom ain Identity of the Main Deck. 103.1.b.1. Cards included in your Deck m ust abide by your Dom ain Identity. 103.1.b.2. Your deck’s Dom ain Identity is dictated by the dom ains of your Cham pion Legend. In the default card fram e, these dom ains appear as sym bols in the legend’s upper left corner. 103.1.b.3. If a card has a single Dom ain , then that card is perm itted in the Dom ain Identity that corresponds to the sam e Dom ain. 103.1.b.4. If a card has m ore than one Dom ain , then that card is perm itted only in a Dom ain Identity that contains all of the indicated Dom ains on that card. 103.2. A Main Deck of at least 40 cards 1 Chosen Cham pion Unit Units Gear Spells 103.2.a. Chosen Cham pion 103.2.a.1. This w ill be placed in the Cham pion Zone at the start of the gam e. 103.2.a.2. M ust be a cham pion unit w ith a cham pion tag that m atches the tag on your Cham pion Legend. Example: Loose Cannon has the tag Jinx . Therefore, a player could choose Jinx, Rebel or Jinx, D em olitionist as their Chosen Cham pion , because they also have the tag Jinx . Example: Tibbers has the tag Annie , but it is a signature unit, not a cham pion unit. It cannot be your Chosen Cham pion , even if your Cham pion Legend has the tag Annie . 103.2.a.3. A player’s Chosen Cham pion is both the speciﬁc card chosen for this slot during D eck Building and also any Cham pion Unit w ith the sam e nam e as the speciﬁc card selected for this speciﬁc slot during the course of play. Example: A player chose Jinx, Rebel as their Chosen Cham pion. O ne copy of Jinx, Rebel starts the gam e in their Chosen Cham pion zone. Any additional copies of Jinx, Rebel in their M ain D eck, their hand, their trash, or on the board also count as their Chosen Cham pion for any gam e rules and effects that care about Chosen Cham pion status during the gam e. 103.2.b. Your Main Deck can include up to 3 copies of the sam e nam ed card. 103.2.b.1. This includes your Chosen Cham pion. Example: A deck could include Volibear, Furious as its Chosen Cham pion and still include 2 m ore copies of Volibear, Furious. 103.2.b.2. Cards have different nam es even if they represent the sam e character. Example: A deck could include 3 copies of Yasuo, Rem orseful and 3 copies of Yasuo, W indrider, because they have different nam es. 103.2.c. Subject to Dom ain Identity. 103.2.d. Your deck m ay only contain 3 total Signature cards that have the sam e Cham pion tag as your Cham pion Legend. 103.2.d.1.

For all purposes, including rules and deckbuilding, such a card’s nam e is “[Short N am e], [Subtitle]”. Example: Kai’Sa, Evolutionary and Kai’Sa, Survivor both have the short nam e Kai’Sa, but they have different nam es. You can include 3 of each in your deck under norm al deckbuilding rules.

That player chooses targets. 185.4.d. That player chooses m odes. 185.4.e. That player pays costs. 186. W hen a gam e effect or rules text refers to the Controller of a speciﬁc object, it can be referring to either context interchangeably. 186.1.

Com bat begins there. 323. Special Cleanups are Cleanup steps invoked at speciﬁc tim es that have additional steps not present in a norm al Cleanup. 323.1. W hen a Special Cleanup is invoked, the unique steps added w ill be inserted and deﬁned by the sub-section that invokes it. Example: W hen a Com bat Cleanup is invoked, the Com bat section deﬁnes w hat steps are added to the Cleanup. 323.2. If events during a Special Cleanup require another Cleanup, a norm al Cleanup is invoked, not another iteration of the Special Cleanup . 324. Chains and Showdowns 325. Players can act during the follow ing W indows of Opportunity that occur during the course of regular play: 325.1. D uring a Chain 325.2. D uring a Showdown 326. Chains 327. The Chain is a Non-Board Zone that tem porarily exists w henever a card is played or an ability is activated. 327.1. Cards are placed here as part of the process of being played. 327.2. Abilities are queued here as part of the process of resolving. See rule 357. Abilities for more information. 328. Cards and abilities added to the chain are added as Pending Chain Item s that becom e Finalized Chain Item s. 328.1. Pending Item s are on the Chain. 328.2. Chain Item s are Pending until the “Check Legality” step of playing a card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 328.3. W hen a Pending Chain Item is no longer Pending it is ﬁnalized and becom es a Finalized Chain Item . 329. The Chain exists as long as a Chain Item is on it. 329.1. O nly one Chain can exist at a tim e. 329.2. If a card w ould begin to be played w hile a Chain already exists, it is placed on the existing Chain. 330. The State of the Turn is partially determ ined by w hether or not the Chain currently exists. 330.1. The turn is said to be in a Closed State if a Chain exists. 330.1.a. Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a Closed State. 330.1.b. Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a Closed State. 330.2. The turn is said to be in an Open State if no Chain exists. 331. Steps of Resolving Chain Item s 332. W henever a card or token is played or an ability is activated or triggered, a Chain is created. 332.1. The player that created the chain becom es the ﬁrst Active Player. 332.2. The Active Player is a designator sim ilar to, but distinct from , Turn Player. 332.3. Sim ilar to the Turn Player , this designation w ill pass betw een players over the course of play. 333. Step 1: Finalize 333.1. If one or m ore Item s are Pending , their controllers m ust com plete the steps of Playing those Pending Item s until they are Finalized Item s or leave the Chain. 333.1.a. This process does not pass Priority. 333.1.b. Each Item is Finalized in the order it w as appended to the Chain. 333.1.c. Abilities that Add resources, Units , and Gear resolve im m ediately w hen Finalized and do not progress to Step 2: Execute. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 333.1.c.1. If the Chain is em pty, play proceeds in an Open State. 333.1.c.2. If the Chain is not em pty and there are one or m ore Pending Item s , repeat Step 1. 333.1.c.3. If the Chain is not em pty and there are no Pending Item s , the controller of the new est item on the chain gains Priority and becom es the Active Player. Proceed to Step 2: Execute. 334. Step 2: Execute 334.1. The Active Player m ay do any the follow ing: 334.1.a. Play a Card that is legally tim ed. 334.1.a.1. Cards , by default, cannot be played during a Closed State. 334.1.a.2. A Legally Tim ed Card w ould be a Card w ith Reaction. 334.1.a.3. O ther exceptions m ay be created during regular play. 334.1.a.4. The card w ill be added to the chain as a Pending Item , follow ing the steps of playing a card. 334.1.a.5. This can be an additional card to the item that Started the Chain in the case of the ﬁrst Active Player after creating the Chain. 334.1.a.6. W hether a Card is legally tim ed is evaluated during the “Check Legality” step of Playing a Card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 334.1.a.7. Playing a card w ill create one or m ore Pending Item s . Return to Step 1: Finalize. 334.1.b. Activate Abilities of Gam e Objects that are legally tim ed. See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information. 334.1.b.1. All rules for legally tim ed cards apply to legally tim ed abilities. 334.1.b.2. Activating abilities w ill create one or m ore Pending Item s . Return to Step 1: Finalize. 334.1.c. Pass Priority 334.1.c.1. The Active Player passes Priority to the next Player in Turn Order. Proceed to Step 3: Pass. 335. Step 3: Pass 335.1. If all players have passed Priority w ithout adding any item s to the Chain , proceed to Step 4: Resolve. 335.2. O therw ise, the Active Player passes Priority to the next Player in Turn Order. Return to Step 3: Execute. 336. Step 4: Resolve 336.1. The new est item on the Chain resolves. Execute its gam e effects in their entirety. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information on resolving spells. See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information on resolving abilities. 336.2. If the Chain is em pty, play proceeds in an Open State. 336.3. If the Chain is not em pty and there are one or m ore Pending Item s , return to Step 1: Finalize. 336.4. If the Chain is not em pty and there are no Pending Item s , the controller of the new est item on the chain gains Priority and becom es the Active Player. Return to Step 2: Execute. 337. Showdowns 338. A Showdown is a W indow of Opportunity in w hich Players have an Open State in w hich they m ay play Spells in an alternating fashion. 338.1. Each spell played this w ay creates a Chain as norm al. 339. The State of the turn is partially determ ined by w hether or not a Showdown is in progress. 339.1. The turn is said to be in a Showdown State if a Showdown is in progress. 339.1.a. Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a Showdown State. 339.1.b. Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a Showdown State. 339.2. The turn is said to be in a Neutral State if no Showdown is in progress. 340. A Showdown begins w hen Control of a Battleﬁeld is Contested and the turn is in a Neutral Open State. 340.1. If Control of a Battleﬁeld is Contested betw een tw o players, then a Showdown w ill be opened as the ﬁrst step of Com bat. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 340.2. If Control of a Battleﬁeld is Contested and the Battleﬁeld in question is uncontrolled w hen it becom es Contested , a Showdown is opened during the Cleanup at the end of the action that caused the Battleﬁeld to becom e Contested. 341. As a Showdown begins, the player w ho applied Contested status to the Battleﬁeld gains Focus. 342. W hen a Showdown begins, it m ay or m ay not begin w ith an Initial Chain. 342.1. Showdowns that open as a result of Com bat m ay have an Initial Chain of Triggered Abilities. 342.1.a. These Triggered Abilities should be put on the chain ﬁrst by the player w ith Focus , then proceeding w ith players w ithout the D efender designation in Turn Order. Finally, the player w ith the Defender designation w ill add their Triggered Abilities , if any, to the Chain. 342.1.b. If there are no such Triggered Abilities present during a Com bat -initiated Showdown then no Initial Chain is created, but the Showdown w ill still proceed. 343. W hen the last item on the chain resolves during a Showdown , Focus passes, and the next Player gains both Focus and Priority. 343.1. Focus does not pass w hen the last item on the Initial Chain resolves, if there w as one. Instead the player w ith Focus proceeds w ith play. 344. D uring a Showdown , the player w ith Focus m ay do one of the follow ing: 344.1. Play a spell that is legally tim ed. 344.1.a. The spell w ill start a Chain as norm al. 344.2. Activate Abilities of Gam e Objects that are legally tim ed. See rule 357. Abilities for more information. 344.3. Pass. 344.3.a. If all Players have passed once in sequence, the Showdown ends. 344.3.a.1. Perform a Cleanup. 344.4. O therw ise, Focus passes to the next Player in Turn Order. 345. If all players pass Focus w ithout playing a spell or activating an ability, then the Showdown Closes. 345.1. If this Showdown opened as a result of Com bat, proceed w ith the rem aining steps of Com bat to resolve the phase. See rule 441. The Steps of Combat for more information. 345.2. If this Showdown opened as a result of Contested being applied to a Battleﬁeld w ithout a controller, do one of the follow ing: 345.2.a. If only one player’s Units rem ain at the Battleﬁeld , and if that player does not already Control the Battleﬁeld , that player establishes Control over the Battleﬁeld . See rule 179. Control for more information on Control . See rule 446.1. for more information on Conquering . 345.2.a.1. This results in a Conquer if that player has not yet scored that Battleﬁeld this turn. 345.2.b. If tw o players’ Units rem ain at the Battleﬁeld , Control cannot be established and the Battleﬁeld rem ains Contested . This results in a Staged Com bat . See rule 437. Combat for more information. 345.2.b.1. The player w ho applied Contested to the Battleﬁeld w ill be the Attacker in the subsequent Com bat. 346. Playing Cards 347. Playing a card is the act of a player utilizing their cards. 347.1. A card is Played w hen it has ﬁnished this process in its entirety. 347.2. Tokens are not cards, but can still be Played. See rule 173. Tokens for more information. 348. Cards have different behaviors w hen played. 348.1. Perm anents becom e Gam e Objects w hen Played. 348.2. Spells create gam e effects that are executed, then the card is placed in the trash w hen Played. 349. Cards have different states during the process of being played. 349.1. W hen initially being played cards are Pending, as Pending Chain Item s. 349.2. N ear the end of the process cards w ill cease being Pending and becom e Finalized Chain Item s . 350. The Process of Play 351. 1. Rem ove the card from the zone you are playing it from and put it onto the Chain. 351.1. This Closes the State. See rule 307. States of the Turn for more information. 351.2. This item becom es Pending. 351.3. If another Card Effect or ability is currently resolving, continue resolving it before proceeding w ith any further steps of this process. 352. 2. M ake necessary choices. 352.1. If the card is a spell, or has an effect that speciﬁes a choice "As I am played," those choices are m ade now . 352.2. For Units , choose a valid Location w here that Unit w ill be placed upon being Played. 352.2.a By default, Valid locations include the controller’s Base or a Battleﬁeld the controller controls. 352.2.b Som e Gam e Effects m ay grant players perm ission to play Units to locations that are not norm ally Valid . Such locations becom e Valid for the purposes of Playing the Unit. . 352.3. For Spells and Abilities that Move one or m ore Units , choose a valid Location as the Move Destination for each Move that w ill be perform ed. 352.4. If a card requires you to speciﬁcally choose one or m ore Gam e Objects , that choice is m ade now . 352.4.a. This does not include cards that affect one or m ore Gam e Objects based on criteria. Example: "Stun a unit at a battleﬁeld" is a Choice. Example: "Kill all gear" is not a Choice. 352.4.b. This does not include m aking choices for Triggered Abilities of perm anents, even if those abilities trigger w hen the perm anent is played. Example: A unit w ith a triggered ability that says "W hen I'm played, kill a unit" does not require you to choose a target as it's played. The target w ill be chosen w hen the ability triggers. See rule 375. Triggered Abilities for more information. 352.5. Targeting 352.6. W hen a card Chooses one or m ore speciﬁc Gam e Objects to affect, it is Targeted. 352.7. In order to put a spell or ability on the chain, valid choices m ust be m ade for all targets. 352.8. A target is a valid choice if it m eets all of the follow ing requirem ents: 352.8.a. It is a perm anent or rune on the board, a spell or ability on the chain, a player or zone, or speciﬁed explicitly or im plicitly as being in som e other zone. e.g., “Kill a unit” targets a unit on the board. e.g., “Recycle a unit from your trash” targets a unit card in your trash. 352.8.a.1. “Unit,” “gear,” and “rune” refer to objects on the Board unless speciﬁed otherw ise. 352.8.a.2. “Spell” and “ability” refer to objects on the Chain unless speciﬁed otherw ise. 352.8.a.3. “Facedow n card” refers to a card in a Facedow n Zone unless speciﬁed otherw ise. 352.8.a.4. “Legend” refers to a legend in the Legend Zone. 352.8.a.5. “Chosen Cham pion” and “unit in the Cham pion Zone” refer to a unit in the Cham pion Zone unless speciﬁed otherw ise. 352.8.b. It m eets all targeting restrictions. e.g., A unit is a valid target for a spell that refers to a “unit at a battleﬁeld,” “enemy unit,” “unit you control,” or “unit with Might 4 or greater” only if it meets the appropriate criteria. 352.8.c. It is not the spell or ability itself. e.g., A spell that says “Counter a spell” cannot target itself. e.g., An ability of a permanent can target that permanent, because abilities and their sources are separate objects. 352.9. If a spell or ability requires one or m ore players to choose objects, players, or zones that are not targets, those choices are m ade on resolution. 352.9.a. Passive abilities never have targets. 352.9.b. Replacem ent effects never have targets. 352.9.c. Units and gear never have targets, although their abilities m ay. 352.10. A gam e object, player, or zone m entioned in the text of a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability is a target UN LESS any of the follow ing are true: 352.10.a. It is in a zone w hose inform ation status is not Public. e.g., “Ready a legend” targets a legend, because the Legend Zone is Public. e.g., “Return a unit from your trash to your hand” targets a unit card in your trash, because your trash is Public. e.g., “You may play a unit from your hand, ignoring its costs” does not target a unit card in your hand, because your hand is not a public zone. 352.10.a.1. Public zones are Battleﬁeld Zones, Bases, Trashes, Legend Zones, Cham pion Zones, and Facedow n Zones. 352.10.b. It is included only as part of a targeting restriction for another choice. e.g., “Kill a unit at a battleﬁeld” targets a unit, but not a battleﬁeld, because the units are targets and “at a battleﬁeld” is a restriction. e.g., “Kill all units at a battleﬁeld” targets a battleﬁeld, but not any units. e.g., “Move a unit to a battleﬁeld” targets both a unit and a battleﬁeld. 352.10.c. It is included only as part of a cost, trigger condition, or replacem ent effect. e.g., “As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit” doesn’t target anything. e.g., “When a friendly unit dies, kill a gear” targets a gear, but not a friendly unit. e.g., “When you play me, the next time a friendly unit would die this turn, return it to your hand instead” doesn’t target anything. The replacement effect applies when any friendly unit dies. e.g., “Choose a friendly unit. The next time it would die this turn, return it to your hand instead” targets a friendly unit, because “choose a friendly unit” is not part of the replacement effect. 352.10.c.1. This includes costs w ithin instructions, identiﬁed by phrases like “[do X] to [do Y].” The cost w ithin that instruction is “[do X].” e.g., “When I hold, you may kill another friendly unit here to draw 1” does not target anything. e.g., “When you play me, you may spend a buff to move a friendly unit” targets the friendly unit, but not the buff. 352.10.d. It is program m atically selected based on its characteristics rather than chosen by the spell or ability’s controller. e.g., “Kill all units at a battleﬁeld” targets a battleﬁeld, but does not target any units. e.g., “Kill all units at battleﬁelds” doesn’t target anything. e.g., “Destroy a unit. Its controller draws 2 cards” targets the unit, but not its controller. e.g., “Ready your legend” doesn’t target anything, because you can only have one legend. e.g., “Ready a friendly legend” targets a legend, because in a 2v2 game there are two friendly legends. e.g., “Recycle all cards in your trash” doesn’t target anything, because it affects all cards and you only have one trash. 352.10.d.1. This exception applies solely to objects for w hich no choice is ever possible. 352.10.d.2. This exception does not apply to objects that are the only valid choice at the m om ent a spell or ability is placed on the chain, but w hich w ould require a choice under other circum stances. e.g., “Kill a unit at a battleﬁeld” always targets a unit, even if that unit is the only unit currently at a battleﬁeld. 352.10.e. It is part of a set of objects chosen in w hole or in part by other players. e.g., “Each player kills a unit they control” does not target. Each player, including the one who played the spell, chooses a unit to kill as the spell or ability resolves. 352.10.f. It is identiﬁed in an instruction that a player “m ust” com plete. e.g., “You must recycle one of your runes” doesn’t target anything. You choose from among your runes as the spell or ability resolves. e.g., “Recycle a rune you control” targets a rune. You choose a rune you control as you put the spell or ability on the chain. 352.11. Som e cards identify a group of Targets w ith Targeting Requirem ents that m ust be m et by the group as a w hole. 352.11.a. As they’re ﬁnalized on the chain, such cards can choose any group of valid targets that collectively fulﬁll the targeting restriction. 352.11.b. If the group of targets no longer collectively fulﬁll the targeting restriction as the spell or ability resolves, that spell or ability’s controller can choose a subset of the original targets that fulﬁlls the targeting requirem ent for the spell or ability to affect. Example: A player plays Fox-Fire, a spell that says in part “Kill any num ber of units at a battleﬁeld w ith total M ight 4 or less.” That player chooses four 1 [M ] Recruit tokens at a single battleﬁeld. As a Reaction, another player gives tw o of those Recruits +1 [M ], so the Recruits’ M ights are 1, 1, 2, and 2. Then Fox-Fire resolves. The Recruits no longer have total M ight 4 or less, so Fox-Fire’s controller m ust choose a legal subset of the original targets to affect. They could choose to kill the tw o 2 [M ] Recruits, or the tw o 1 [M ] Recruits plus one 2 [M ] Recruit. The units they choose are Fox-Fire’s rem aining legal targets. They can’t choose to affect units at the sam e battleﬁeld that w eren’t initially chosen as targets, and they can’t affect any units that are no longer at the chosen battleﬁeld. 352.12. If a card speciﬁes that a player may choose som e num ber of Gam e Objects to be affected by a card, then all choices are considered targeted and chosen independently. 352.13. If a card speciﬁes that a player chooses “any num ber” or “up to” som e num ber of Gam e Objects to be affected, they m ay choose any num ber of available targets, including zero. If they choose zero, the spell or ability can be played w ithout any targets. 352.14. Splitting 352.14.a. If a card speciﬁes that an am ount of dam age m ay be split am ong som e num ber of Units , then each Unit chosen is Targeted. 352.14.b. The Targets are chosen w hen the spell or ability is ﬁnalized on the chain. 352.14.c. A num ber of Targets can only be chosen up to, and not exceeding, the initial am ount of dam age available w hen the spell is played. Example: A player playing a spell that instructs them to "Split 5 dam age" m ay only choose up to 5 units, but m ay choose few er. 352.14.d. Each Target is valid, and contributes to Chosen triggers individually. 352.14.e. The choice of how m uch dam age is divided across the split is not decided until the resolution of the spell or ability. 352.14.f. Each Target m ust receive a valid am ount of dam age. 352.14.g. Valid dam age is a positive integer am ount, greater than or equal to 1 dam age. 352.14.h. If, at resolution of the spell or effect, there are m ore Targets than available dam age to divide, then the player w ho controls the effect dealing dam age determ ines w hich Targets cease being Targets. 352.14.i. Any costs that w ere paid, or effects that w ere triggered as a result of those Gam e Objects being chosen as Targets rem ain in effect, paid, or otherw ise triggered. 352.15. These choices cannot be changed after this step. 352.16. A player m ay not m ake choices during this step that w ill determ inistically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice. Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, w hich says "As an additional cost to play m e, kill a friendly unit." They control exactly one unit, w hich is at a battleﬁeld. They can't choose to play Cruel Patron to that battleﬁeld, because by the tim e they have ﬁnished paying costs, they w ill no longer control that battleﬁeld. 353. 3. D eterm ine Total Cost. 353.1. If an ability or instruction allow s you to "ignore" one or m ore of a card's costs, set the appropriate Base Cost(s) of the card to zero. 353.1.a. If a card allow s a player to play a card "ignoring its cost," its base Energy cost and base Power cost are set to zero. 353.1.b. If a card instructs a player to play a card "ignoring its Energy cost" or "ignoring its Pow er cost," only the appropriate cost is set to zero, and the rem aining cost still applies. 353.1.c. Further additional costs and/or cost increases applied in subsequent steps m ay raise the card's Total Cost above zero. Example: Legion Rearguard is a Fury unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Pow er and has Accelerate. A player plays Legion Rearguard and is instructed to ignore its costs, but chooses to pay the Accelerate cost. They ignore Legion Rearguard's Base Cost of 2 Energy, but the optional additional cost of 1 Energy and 1 Fury Pow er is added to its Total Cost and m ust be paid. 353.2. Apply additional costs in any order. 353.2.a. Mandatory Additional Costs 353.2.a.1. Som e Additional Costs speciﬁed by Passive Abilities on the card being played or another card are Mandatory , and m ust be paid to com plete playing the card. They use the phrase "as an additional cost" and don't include the w ord "m ay." Example: A unit has the passive ability "As an additional cost to play m e, kill a friendly unit." To play that unit, a player m ust kill a friendly unit. See rule 360. Passive Abilities for more information. 353.2.a.2. The cost im posed by the Deﬂect keyw ord is a Mandatory Additional Cost. See rule 735. Deﬂect for more information. 353.2.b. Optional Additional Costs 353.2.b.1. Som e Optional Costs speciﬁed by Passive Abilities on the card being played or another card are Non-Mandatory , and m ust be paid only if the player m ade the choice to pay them in rule 352. They use the phrase "as an additional cost" and the w ord "m ay." Example: A unit has the ability "As you play m e, you m ay discard 1 as an additional cost. If you do, reduce m y cost by [2]." W hile playing the unit, its controller declares their intention to pay the additional cost in rule 352 , applies that additional cost in rule 353.2 , applies the discount granted by paying that cost in rule 353.4 , and discards a card to pay that additional cost in rule 354.2. See rule 360. Passive Abilities for more information. 353.3. Apply cost increases. 353.4. Apply discounts in any order. 353.4.a. D iscounts m ay be applied by the card being played or by any other card or effect. 353.4.b. D iscounts m ay say that cards "cost [am ount] less" or that one or m ore of their costs are "reduced by [am ount]." 353.4.c. If a discount applies a m inim um cost, that m inim um applies only to that discount. Example: Eager Apprentice says "W hile I'm at a battleﬁeld, the Energy costs for spells you play is reduced by [1], to a m inim um of [1]." A player w ho controls Eager Apprentice and a unit w ith 7 M ight plays Sky Splitter, a spell that costs 8 Energy and says "This spell's Energy cost is reduced by the highest M ight am ong units you control." That player can choose to apply Eager Apprentice's discount ﬁrst, reducing Sky Splitter's Energy cost to 7, then apply Sky Splitter's discount, reducing its Energy cost to 0. If they applied these discounts in the other order, Sky Splitter's Energy cost w ould be 1. 353.4.d. D iscounts can reduce additional costs, including to 0. 353.4.d.1. An optional additional cost w as "paid" if the player m ade the decision in rule 352 to pay it. It doesn't m atter how m uch the player actually paid. Example: Clockw ork Keeper is a unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Pow er and says "As you play m e, you m ay pay [C] as an additional cost. If you do, draw " A player controls a card that says "Units you play cost [A] less." That player plays Clockw ork Keeper and chooses to pay the optional additional cost of [C]. They w ill draw a card, even though the optional additional cost w as reduced to 0. 353.5. Energy and Pow er costs can't be reduced below 0. 353.6. Costs m ay be Energy costs, Pow er costs, or non-standard costs. Example: A card reads "As an additional cost to play m e, kill a friendly unit." Killing a friendly unit is an additional cost to play that card. 354. 4. Pay the card's costs. 354.1. In total, pay the com bined Energy cost (if any) and Power cost (if any). 354.1.a. D uring this step, the spell's controller can use activated abilities w ith the Reaction tag that Add resources to add Energy and Power to pay the spell's costs. See rule 161. Rune Pools and rule 416. Add for more information. 354.2. In addition, pay any non-standard Cost sum m ed in rule 353.2 in any order. 354.2.a. Costs that are replaced w ith other events by replacem ent effects are still considered paid. Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, w hich says "As an additional cost to play m e, kill a friendly unit." They also control Zhonya’s H ourglass, w hich says “If a friendly unit w ould die, kill this instead. H eal that unit, exhaust it, and recall it.” They choose to kill a friendly unit during rule 353.2 , but as they pay the cost in rule 354.2 , Zhonya’s H ourglass replaces that unit’s death. The cost is considered paid, and the player can continue playing Cruel Patron. 354.3. A player m ay not pay costs during this step that w ill determ inistically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice. Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, w hich says "As an additional cost to play m e, kill a friendly unit." They control m ultiple units, one of w hich is alone at a battleﬁeld. D uring rule 352.2. , they chose to play Cruel Patron to that battleﬁeld. W hile paying costs, they can't choose to kill the unit at that battleﬁeld, because then they w ill no longer control that battleﬁeld and Cruel Patron cannot legally be played there. If they controlled that battleﬁeld w ith m ultiple units, any of those units w ould be a legal choice, because they w ould still control the battleﬁeld after killing one. 355. 5. Check legality. 355.1. Check that all chosen targets are legal. 355.2. Ensure that the outcom e of the effect of this card being played w ould not create an illegal state. Example: Check that a spell's execution does not create a state w here a Battleﬁeld has Units controlled by 3 different players. 355.3. If the card, if continued to be played, w ould create an illegal state, or if a choice or action at this state is illegal, the actions taken in this process are undone and the action is cancelled. 356. 6. Finalize this card and proceed w ith the card's category of Play. 356.1. This card is no longer Pending . 356.2. A Perm anent leaves the Chain and becom es a Gam e Object. 356.2.a. Any passive abilities becom e active. 356.2.b. Execute all rules text on the card, from top to bottom . 356.2.c. If it is a Unit , it enters the Board exhausted at the Location that w as chosen. 356.2.d. If it is a Gear, it enters the Board Ready at the player's Base. 356.3. A Spell lingers on the Chain. 356.3.a. This card becom es a Finalized Chain Item . 356.3.b. If there are other Pending Item s on the Chain, then the controller of those Pending Item s com pletes Steps 2 through 5 of Playing Cards for those item s before continuing. See rule 326. Chains for more information . 356.3.c. O ther players have an opportunity to play Reactions before the resolution of spells. See rule 326. Chains for more information. 356.3.d. O therw ise, execute the gam e effect of the spell, from top to bottom of the rules text of the card and then place the card in the Trash of the owning player. 356.3.e. H andling illegal and im possible instructions 356.3.e.1. The spell resolves even if som e or all of its targets are illegal. 356.3.e.2. A target is illegal as the spell resolves if it no longer m eets the targeting requirem ents of the spell, or if it has changed Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone. 356.3.e.3. If a target ceases to m eet the targeting requirem ents w hile the spell is on the chain, then m eets them again, it's a legal target. Example: A spell targets "a unit at a battleﬁeld." A player reacts w ith a spell that m oves the unit to base, then another player reacts w ith a spell that m oves it back to that battleﬁeld, then the original spell resolves. The unit is a legal target. 356.3.e.4. If a target changes Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone and then returns to its original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it's not treated as the sam e object. Examples: An enem y unit at a battleﬁeld is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an enem y, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battleﬁeld. A unit w ith 3 or less M ight is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit or if its M ight is greater than 3. Som ething that's exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer exhausted. (It can't stop being "som ething.") A spell that's played from hidden can norm ally only target its ow n battleﬁeld or som ething at that battleﬁeld. A target for such a spell m ay cease to be a legal target if it m oves from the battleﬁeld w here that spell w as played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirem ent otherw ise. 356.3.e.5. If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the spell as it resolves. Example: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says "D eal 4 to a unit at a battleﬁeld. D raw 1." The unit's controller uses a Reaction to m ove the unit to their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any dam age. Void Seeker's controller still draw s 1. 356.3.e.6. Instructions that can't be follow ed, either because of illegal targets or other circum stances, are ignored. 356.3.e.7. If all of an instruction's Targets becom e Invalid or Unavailable by the tim e the spell is ﬁnished being played, that instruction w ill not execute. 356.3.e.8. If an instruction has m ore than one Target and few er than all of the Targets becom e Invalid or Unavailable by the tim e the spell is ﬁnished being played, the instruction w ill execute, w ith only the Targets available and valid being operated on. 356.3.e.9. The process for a card's choice becom ing Invalid or Unavailable is referred to as m istargeting. Example: A spell has the instruction "D eal 2 to a unit at a battleﬁeld." Before that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is m oved to its base. The instruction w ill not be executed, because it speciﬁes that the unit it chooses m ust be at a Battleﬁeld, and by the tim e it attem pted to execute, the unit w as no longer valid as a choice. 356.3.e.10. It is possible for none of a spell's instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all of them requiring targets to act on and all of those targets becom ing Invalid or Unavailable . In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played. Example: A player plays a spell that reads "D eal 2 to a unit at a battleﬁeld" w ith no other instructions, and chooses an enem y unit at a battleﬁeld. They also control a unit w ith the ability "W hen you play a spell, give m e +1 [M ] this turn." Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is m oved to its base. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but the unit's ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M ]. 356.3.e.11. Instructions that can be partially follow ed are follow ed as m uch as possible and ignored otherw ise. Example: A player plays a spell that says "D iscard 2, then draw 2" If their hand is em pty, the instruction to discard 2 w ill be ignored. They'll still draw 2. If they had 1 card in hand, they w ould discard it and draw 2. 356.3.e.12. If the spell checks inform ation about a target that is no longer legal or a card or perm anent w hose location, zone, or status has changed such that that inform ation is no longer available, that check returns "null" and all calculations based on it are ignored. Examples: A unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having null M ight, null cost, etc. A unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted nor readied, etc. Baited H ook says "[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of your M ain D eck. You m ay banish a unit from am ong them that has M ight up to 1 m ore than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest." W hile Baited H ook’s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts w ith a spell that returns the friendly unit to its ow ner's hand. Because the friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be killed and its M ight is treated as null. Baited H ook’s controller reveals the top 5 cards of their M ain D eck, but can’t choose any unit from am ong them . 356.3.e.13. A spell or ability that m oves som ething to a different zone as a cost or effect can "look back" at its characteristics before it changes zones. 357. Abilities 358. An Ability is the structured rules and capabilities of Gam e Objects or Spells. 358.1. An Ability has m ultiple structures. Passive Abilities Replacem ent Effects Activated Abilities Triggered Abilities Delayed Abilities 359. A card can have m ore than one Ability and m ore than one type of Ability. 360. Passive Abilities 361. Conditions, rules, constraints, or statem ents that affect the course of regular play. 361.1. These abilities have a w ide variety of form ats to recognize. Example: "I get +1[M ] w hile you have 2 or m ore cards in your hand." Example: "Friendly Yordles at m y battleﬁeld have [Shield]." 361.2. They can be recognized by being statem ents of fact. 361.3. Passive Abilities can be conditional. 361.3.a. Conditional Passive Abilities can be recognized by the occurrence of "if" or "w hile" as part of the statem ent of the ability. Example: " W hile I'm attacking or defending alone, I have +2 [M ]." Example: " If an opponent controls a battleﬁeld, I enter ready." 362. Presence on Perm anents 362.1. Passive Abilities of Perm anents are typically only active w hile on the Board. 363. Presence on Card outside of the Board 363.1. Passive Abilities of cards in zones that are outside of the Board w ill self-describe their context. Example: The passive ability "Play m e only during an opponent's turn." applies in any zone from w hich that card can be played. 363.2. Passive Abilities can alter the costs of cards as they are played. 363.2.a. These apply at all tim es in any zone from w hich the card w ith the ability can be played. 364. Replacem ent Effects 365. An ability that alters the application of another gam e effect or gam e rule. 365.1. Passive Abilities can be Replacem ent Effects. 366. Replacem ent Effects intercede during the execution of a Gam e Effect and alter its execution. 366.1. A Replacem ent Effect can be identiﬁed by the presence of the term "instead." Example: Zhonya's H ourglass reads "The next tim e a friendly unit w ould die, kill this instead. Recall that unit exhausted." This is a replacem ent effect that alters the execution of any Gam e Effect that w ould kill a friendly unit. 367. A Replacem ent Effect can alter the typical ﬂow of play, including other cards' executions. 368. If m ore than one Replacem ent Effect applies to the sam e event being executed, then the ow ner of the object being acted on determ ines the order the Replacem ent Effects w ill apply. 368.1. If it is a player being acted on, that player decides the order the Replacem ent Effects w ill apply. 368.2. If the affected object is an Uncontrolled Battleﬁeld then the Current Turn Player decides the order the Replacem ent Effects w ill apply. 369. Activated Abilities 370. Activated Abilities are repeatable effects w ith a cost. They follow a process of going onto the chain and resolving, sim ilar to Playing a Card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 370.1. Activated Abilities are recognized by the presence of a ":" in the text of the card, preceded by a cost and succeeded by an effect. Example: "[2]: D raw 1" is an activated ability. The cost is 2 energy. The effect is to draw 1 card. 370.2. Activated Abilities use the chain. 370.2.a. D eclare activation of the Ability. 370.2.a.1. The ability goes on the chain but has no card to represent it, so players need to take note that it is now a Closed State. 370.2.b. Proceed w ith executing the Chain. 370.2.b.1. Follow the steps of “Playing or Activating Abilities” in rule 386 . This ability w ill becom e a Pending Chain Item . 370.2.b.2. O pponents have an opportunity to respond, as appropriate, as if a card w as played onto the chain. 370.2.b.3. If no further action is taken, execute the Activated Ability. 371. The controlling player chooses w hen and w hether to activate an Activated Ability. 372. Activated abilities are present on Gam e Objects and som e Spells. 373. Can prim arily be activated w hile on the Board. 374. All Activated Abilities can only be activated on the Controlling Player's Turn and during an Open State. 375. Triggered Abilities 376. Triggered Abilities are repeatable effects that happen w hen a Condition is m et. 376.1. Triggered Abilities can usually be recognized by the w ord "w hen" follow ed by a gam e action or event; the w ord "at" follow ed by a point in tim e during the turn sequence; or the phrase “the [N th] tim e” follow ed by a gam e action or event. Examples: " W hen you conquer here, you m ay spend a buff to draw 1." "At the end of your turn, ready 2 runes." “The ﬁrst tim e I m ove each turn, you m ay ready som ething else that's exhausted.” 376.1.a. The phrases that identify triggered abilities do not alw ays appear at the beginning of sentences or abilities. 376.1.b. If an ability triggers “the [N th] tim e” som ething happens and that trigger condition is m et m ultiple tim es sim ultaneously, the ability’s controller picks one of those instances to serve as the trigger condition. The ability triggers only once, due to the chosen condition. Example: W raith of Echoes reads “The ﬁrst tim e another friendly unit dies each turn, draw 1.” That ability hasn’t triggered yet this turn. Tw o other friendly units die sim ultaneously (say, due to com bat dam age). The W raith’s controller chooses one of those deaths to trigger W raith’s ability. 376.2. Triggered Abilities have a Condition and an Effect. 376.2.a. The Condition follow s the W hen. 376.2.b. The Effect is the Instruction that follow s the com m a after the Condition. 376.2.c. The Condition of a Trigger is evaluated after a potentially inciting event has been processed. 376.2.c.1. If a Gam e Object w ith a Triggered Ability that is active in a speciﬁc zone, it is evaluated and subsequently triggered if it enters that zone at the sam e tim e that its Trigger ’s condition is m et. Example: Im m ortal Phoenix says “W hen you kill a unit w ith a spell, you m ay pay [1][C] to play m e from your trash.” This ability triggers if Im m ortal Phoenix is in your trash im m ediately after you kill a unit w ith a spell, even if the unit you killed w ith a spell w as that Im m ortal Phoenix. 376.2.c.2. A Gam e Object w ill not be able to successfully be able to evaluate its Trigger Condition , how ever, if it leaves the zone that its Trigger is active from at the sam e tim e that its Trigger is satisﬁed. Example: Viktor, Leader says “W hen another non-Recruit unit you control dies, play a 1 [M ] Recruit unit token into your base.” This ability triggers if Viktor is on the board im m ediately after another non-Recruit unit you control dies. It does not trigger if Viktor and another non-Recruit unit you control die during the sam e gam e action (for instance, if they are both killed in the sam e Cleanup due to the dam age dealt by Unchecked Pow er). 376.3. W hen a Condition is m et, a Triggered Ability behaves like an Activated Ability and is placed on the Chain. 376.3.a. Triggered Abilities can be put on the Chain during Closed States or Open States on any player's turn. 376.3.b. If m ore than one Triggered Ability is Triggered sim ultaneously, then the player that controls the Abilities selects the order to place them on the Chain. 376.3.b.1. If m ultiple players separately control Triggered Abilities that are Triggered sim ultaneously, then starting w ith the Turn Player and proceeding in Turn Order , each player orders their Triggered Abilities on the Chain. 376.4. Som e Conditions are com m only used and structured in a w ay that explicitly deﬁnes their use and other properties of the Effect that is associated w ith it. 376.4.a. Play Effects are Triggered Abilities w ith the Condition that the Perm anent that has the Play Effect being played to the board. 376.4.a.1. These are com m only structured as “W hen you play m e…” for Units and “W hen you play this…” for Gear. 376.4.a.2. These Triggered Abilities are put on the Chain as Pending Item s after the Perm anent these effects correspond to is ﬁnalized and enters the board. 376.4.a.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Play Effects. 376.4.a.4. Abilities that trigger w hen another object is played are not considered Play Effects. 376.4.b. Conquer Effects are Triggered Abilities w ith a Condition of a Unit participating in, and successfully Conquering a Battleﬁeld. 376.4.b.1. These are com m only structured as “W hen I conquer…” and “W hen you conquer…” 376.4.b.2. This category of Triggered Abilities encom passes only those that are triggered from Units that w ere present during the Conquer action, or Abilities that reference the player that perform ed the Conquer action. 376.4.b.2.a. The Conquer Abilities of Units are put on the Chain as Pending Item s after the Unit(s) these effects correspond to are present at a Battleﬁeld w hen a player gains control of it and gains 1 Victory Point from Conquering. 376.4.b.2.b. The Conquer Abilities of anything that references the player Conquering is put on the Chain as a Pending Item w hen the Condition that the player that controls the triggering source has perform ed a Conquer and gained 1 Victory Point. 376.4.b.2.c. If the act of gaining one point from Conquering is negated or replaced in any w ay, the Conquer Effect w ill still trigger. 376.4.b.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Conquer Effects. 376.4.c. Hold Effects are Triggered Abilities w ith a Condition of a Unit being present at a Battleﬁeld during the Beginning phase w hen a player scores Victory Points from Holding. 376.4.c.1. These are com m only structured as “W hen I hold…” or “W hen you hold…” 376.4.c.2. This category of Triggered Abilities encom passes only those that are triggered from Units that w ere present during the Hold action, or Abilities that reference the player that perform ed the Hold action. 376.4.c.2.a. The Hold Abilities of Units are put on the Chain as Pending Item s after the Unit these effects correspond to are present at a Battleﬁeld w hen a player m aintains control of it and Gains 1 Victory Point during their Beginning Phase from Holding. 376.4.c.2.b. The Hold Abilities of anything that references the player Holding is put on the Chain as a Pending Item w hen the Condition that the player that controls the triggering source has perform ed a Hold and gained 1 Victory Point. 376.4.c.2.c. If the act of gaining one point from Holding is negated or replaced in any w ay, the Hold Effect w ill still trigger. 376.4.c.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as H old Effects. 376.4.d. Attack Triggers are Triggered Abilities that trigger w hen a Unit gains the Attacker designation for the ﬁrst tim e during a com bat. 376.4.d.1. These are com m only structured as “W hen I attack…” 376.4.d.2. These Triggered Abilities are put on the Chain as Pending Item s after the Unit these effects correspond to gains the Attacker designation during Com bat . 376.4.d.2.a. These triggers can only becom e fulﬁlled once per com bat, despite a Unit being able to gain and lose the Attacker designation m ultiple tim es in the sam e com bat. 376.4.d.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Attack Triggers. 376.4.e. Defend Triggers are Triggered Abilities that trigger w hen a Unit gains the Defender designation for the ﬁrst tim e during a com bat. 376.4.e.1. These are com m only structured as “W hen I defend…” 376.4.e.2. These Triggered Abilities are put on the Chain as Pending Item s after the Unit these effects correspond to gains the Defender designation during Com bat . 376.4.e.2.a. These triggers can only becom e fulﬁlled once per com bat, despite a Unit being able to gain and lose the Defender designation m ultiple tim es in the sam e com bat. 376.4.e.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as D efend Triggers. 377. Presence on Perm anents 377.1. Typically active w hile on the Board. 377.2. Triggered Abilities of Perm anents are only able to have their Conditions evaluated w hile on the Board. 378. Presence on Cards outside of the Board 378.1. Triggered Abilities on cards outside of the Board rely on the Inform ation Level of the zone they are in. 378.2. Triggered Abilities outside of the Board w ill self-describe their context. Example: The triggered ability "W hen you conquer, you m ay discard 1 to return this from your trash to your hand." triggers w hile the card it's on is in the trash, and not anyw here else. 379. Reﬂexive Triggers 380. Reﬂexive Triggers are a type of Triggered Ability that create one or m ore Chain Item s w hen their condition is m et. 380.1. Reﬂexive Triggers can be recognized by the phrase “D o this:” or “D o one of the follow ing:”. 380.1.a. “D o this” can be follow ed by “N tim es.” The Reﬂexive Trigger w ill thus be added to the chain N tim es w hen its condition is m et. 380.2. Reﬂexive Triggers w ill be preceded by their conditions, if any. If no condition is present in the ability then the Reﬂexive Trigger w ill alw ays be added to the Chain. 380.3. If present, the Condition of a Reﬂexive Trigger w ill follow the sam e form at as a Triggered Ability. 381. Reﬂexive Triggers use the Chain. 381.1. A new ability is created and added to the chain as a Pending Item . See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information. 381.2. If a Reﬂexive Trigger creates m ore than one Pending Item it creates them all in order, but does not go beyond the ﬁrst step of adding them to the Chain. See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information. 382. D elayed Abilities 383. Delayed Abilities are a type of Ability w hose trigger Condition identiﬁes a speciﬁc tim e during a turn or a speciﬁc event that can occur during a speciﬁc tim efram e. 383.1. Delayed Abilities can be any other type of Ability , and contain all of the properties of that type in addition to the properties of Delayed Abilities. 383.2. Delayed Triggers are Triggered Abilities that can be recognized by describing a speciﬁc tim e of the turn, or by structuring a Triggered Ability w ith a speciﬁc fram e of tim e as a restriction. 383.3. Delayed Replacem ents are Replacem ent Effects that can be recognized by specifying the effect they are replacing at a speciﬁc tim e, or “the [N th] tim e” in the description of the effect as it resolves. 383.4. Delayed Passive Abilities are Passive Abilities that are applicable only during a speciﬁed w indow of tim e. The tim e that the Delayed Passive Ability applies w ill be recognized in the effect that initiates it. 384. Delayed Abilities w ill resolve or be active just like the ability they augm ent, but only during the speciﬁed tim e in the effect that created the Delayed Ability. Example: Ravenborn Tom e reads “The next spell you play this turn deals 1 Bonus D am age” is a Delayed Passive Ability that passively adds 1 dam age to just the next spell played. The next spell is a speciﬁc tim e, and the 1 Bonus D am age is a passive ability. Example: N oxian Guillotine reads “Choose a unit. Kill it the next tim e it takes dam age this turn.” W hen the chosen unit takes dam age is the speciﬁed tim e, and killing it is the condition for a Delayed Triggered Ability. 385.

The “do this” phrasing on Falling Star m eans that it has a reﬂexive triggered ability, w hich places tw o triggered abilities on the chain. As each of those triggered abilities resolve, it deals dam age to the unit chosen for that ability. If one of these abilities deals lethal dam age to a unit, both Falling Star and its ability are considered sources of the dam age, and so both Falling Star and its ability are responsible for killing the unit. This m eans that Falling Star’s controller killed a unit w ith a spell, so Im m ortal Phoenix’s ability w ill trigger. 415.6.

Channel 417.1. Channeling is the action of taking one or m ore Runes from the top of a player's Rune Deck and putting them on the board. 417.2. The Gam e Effect that instructs a player to channel 1 or m ore runes m ay specify the conditions or circum stances under w hich those runes enter the board. Example: A spell reads "Channel 1 rune exhausted." As that spell resolves, its controller puts the top rune of their rune deck onto the board and that rune enters the board exhausted rather than ready. 417.3. Channeling is a Lim ited Action. 417.3.a. Players m ay only channel runes w hen Gam e Effects direct them to do so. 417.4. This action is form atted as "Channel X rune(s)," optionally follow ed by conditions or stipulations. e.g., "Channel 1 rune." e.g., "W hen you play m e, channel 1 rune exhausted." e.g., "Channel 2 runes exhausted. If you couldn't channel 2 runes this w ay, draw 1." 418. Burn Out 418.1. Burning Out is an action a player m ust perform if they attem pt to m ove one or m ore cards from their Main Deck to any other zone in excess of the num ber of cards rem aining in their Main Deck: 418.1.a. If a player m ust Draw cards in excess to the num ber of cards in their deck, they w ill Draw as m any as possible, perform this action, then Draw the rem aining am ount instructed. 418.1.b. If a player m ust put one or m ore cards from their Main Deck in any other zone, such as the Trash , in excess of the num ber of cards in their deck they w ill do so as m uch as possible, perform this action, and then com plete the rem aining num ber required by the instruction. 418.1.c. If an instruction directs a player to look at or reveal cards in excess to the num ber of cards in a player’s Main Deck , that player looks at or Reveals as m any as possible, but does not Burn Out, then proceeds w ith the rest of the instruction. 418.1.c.1. If there are insufﬁcient cards am ong the looked at or revealed cards to perform subsequent actions to the revealed or looked at cards, any further instructions are ignored. This does not cause a Burn Out , even if those instructions w ould cause those cards to change zones. Reminder: Cards are considered in the zone of origin w hile being looked at or revealed, in this case the Main Deck . 418.2. To Burn Out , a player does the follow ing in sequence: 418.2.a. Perform s as m uch of the prescribed action as possible. 418.2.b. Recycles their trash into their M ain D eck. Reminder: W hen m ultiple cards are Recycled to the Main Deck at the sam e tim e, those cards m ust be random ized 418.2.c. Chooses an opponent to gain 1 point. 418.2.d. Com pletes the rem ainder of the action that caused them to burn out. Example: A player attem pts to draw 1 during their D raw Phase w hile their M ain D eck is em pty. That player instead recycles their trash into their M ain D eck, random izing it as norm al, then chooses an opponent to gain 1 point, and then draw s 1. 418.3. A player's M ain D eck m ay rem ain em pty as they Burn Out , usually because their trash is also em pty. W hen they attem pt to perform the original action again, it w ill cause another Burn Out . 418.3.a. Unless som e effect intervenes, this w ill result in them burning out repeatedly, giving 1 point to an opponent each tim e, until an opponent passes the Victory Score and w ins the gam e. 418.4. Burning Out is a Lim ited Action. 418.4.a. Players m ay only burn out w hen Gam e Effects direct them to do so. 418.5. Burning Out is a Replacem ent Effect. See rule 364. Replacement Effects for more information. 419. Double 419.1. Doubling is the act of increasing a num eric attribute by an am ount equal to that attribute’s current value. 419.1.a. This creates an effect that m odulates that attribute by that speciﬁc am ount for the duration speciﬁed by the Gam e Effect that instructed the player to perform this action. Example: A unit with 3 base Might and Shield 2 is in combat as a Defender. Since Shield applies, its current Might is 5. A player chooses it as the target for Last Stand, a spell that reads in part “Double a friendly unit's Might this turn.” Its current Might is 5, so it gets +5 Might this turn, for a current Might of 10. After combat, Shield no longer applies, but the +5 Might from Last Stand does, so the unit’s Might is 8. 419.2 Doubling is a Lim ited Action. 419.2.a. Players m ay only D ouble w hen Gam e Effects direct them to do so. 420. Swap 420.1. Swapping is the act of increasing one num eric value and decreasing another num eric value on som e num ber of Gam e Objects such that their values are reversed. 420.1.a. Swapping creates tw o different effects that apply to each attribute. O ne that Increases one value and one that Decreases the other. 420.1.b. To accom plish this, determ ine the difference betw een these values and then apply an Increase for that am ount to the low er value of the tw o attributes, and a Decrease of that am ount to the higher value of the tw o attributes. 420.1.c If both attributes are the sam e num eric value, Swapping has no effect. 420.2. Swapping is a Lim ited Action. 420.2.a Players m ay only sw ap w hen Gam e Effects direct them to do so. 421. Attach 421.1. Attaching is the act of linking tw o cards on the board together to com bine their effects in som e w ay. This causes one or m ore cards to becom e Attached and at least one card to becom e a Top-Most Card. See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 421.1.a. Attaching affects tw o cards at once. 421.1.a.1. O ne card w ill be designated as the one being Attached , and thus becom e Attached. The other w ill becom e the Top-Most Card. 421.1.b. This is represented by physically laying the Top-Most card on top of the other or others such that all Effect Texts and Might Bonuses are show ing, but nothing else from the card or cards Attached. 421.1.b.1. In the situation w here there is m ore than one card attached to the Top-Most card , they should be stacked in such a w ay that all Effect Text boxes and Might Bonuses are readable. The order of the Attached cards has no bearing on the application of effects. 421.1.c. The Top-Most card has all Effect Text of all cards Attached to it appended to its Rules Text. 421.1.d. The Top-Most Card has its Might m odulated by the Might Bonus of all cards Attached to it. 421.1.e. Attaching one or m ore cards w ill cause those cards’ Rules Text to becom e Inactive for as long as they rem ain Attached. See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 421.1.f. Attaching a card w ill cause it to Detach from any card to w hich it is currently Attached. 421.2. Attaching is a Lim ited Action. 421.2.a. Players m ay only Attach cards w hen directed to by Gam e Effects. 421.3. Attaching cards does not inherently choose or specify a target. H ow ever, Gam e Effects that Attach cards m ay do so. 421.4. W hen a card Attaches to a card, its location becom es the sam e as the new Top-Most Card. 421.4.a. This is not a Move. 422. Detach 422.1. Detaching is the act of unlinking tw o cards that are currently linked through the act of Attaching . This causes one to cease being Attached , and potentially causes the other to cease being a Top-Most card. 422.1.a. Detaching affects only cards that are currently Attached to another card. 422.1.a.1. Gam e effects that instruct a player to Detach a card that is currently not Attached to anything w ill do nothing. 422.1.b. W hen one or m ore cards becom e Detached , they cease to be in the Attached state. 422.1.b.1. To represent this, these cards should no longer be placed under the card they w ere previously placed under as Top-Most Card. 422.1.b.2. If the Top-Most Card no longer has any cards Attached to it after this, it is no longer a Top-Most Card. 422.1.c. The card being Detached has its Effect Text becom e Inactive and its Rules Text cease being Inactive. 422.1.d. The Top-Most Card ceases to have the Effect Text of the card being Detached appended to its Rules Text. 422.1.e. The Top-Most Card ceases to have its Might m odulated by the Might Bonus of the card being Detached. 422.2. Detaching is a Lim ited Action. 422.2.a. Players m ay only Detach cards w hen directed to by Gam e Effects. 422.3. Detaching cards does not inherently choose, or specify a target. H ow ever, Gam e Effects that Detach cards m ay. 422.4. W hen a card Detaches from a Top-Most Card , its location is the sam e as the Top-Most Card from w hich it Detached. 422.4.a. If the Detached card w as a Gear and this causes it to becom e present at a Battleﬁeld , it w ill be Recalled during the next Cleanup. 422.4.b. If the Attached card w as Detached because the Top-Most Card changed zones from a board zone to a non-board zone, then the location that the Attached Card w ill Detach to is the last location the Top-Most Card w as at before changing from a board zone to a non-board zone. 423. Movem ent 424. Moving is a Lim ited Action. 424.1. A Perm anent changing its position from any space on the Board to another space on the Board is a Move , unless it is caused by a corrective Recall . See rule 407. Move for more information. 424.2. A card changing gam e zones does not in itself constitute a Move. 424.3. Moving is instantaneous. 424.3.a. There is no state for Perm anents betw een locations. 424.3.b. Perm anents are either at their Origin before Moving or their Destination after Moving. 424.3.c. Moving does not use the Chain , nor is it able to be Reacted to. 425. Moving is deﬁned by the Origin and Destination of the Perm anent that is changing locations. 425.1. The Origin is w here the Perm anent is starting from . 425.2. The Destination is w here the Perm anent is going to. 425.2.a. In Modes of Play w ith m ore than tw o players, Battleﬁelds w ith Staged Com bats or Com bats in Progress are Invalid Destinations for Moves of all kinds ( Standard Moves or otherw ise) by Units controlled by Players w ho don't already have perm anents at that Battleﬁeld . 425.2.b. If an action w ould require a Move that w ould cause a Unit to becom e present in a Location w here it cannot m ove for any reason, such as a Battleﬁeld w ith tw o players that are not the controller of the Unit perform ing this Move action are in a Com bat or such a Com bat is Staged , it instead Recalls. See rule 432. Recalls for more information. 425.3. Units are the only Perm anents that can Move. 426. Players m ay choose to m ove their Units w ith the Standard Move. See rule 142. for more information on the Standard Move. 427. Spells , Abilities , or other effects m ay cause a Move to occur. 427.1. The source of the Move w ill provide details on any restrictions on legality for Destination. 427.2. Units cannot Move to a Battleﬁeld that already has units from 2 other players present by any m eans. 428. The Destination becom es Contested if it is a Battleﬁeld not controlled by the controller of the Unit or Units that m oved. 429. Units m ay cause a Showdown w ithout a Com bat w hen they Move. 429.1. A Showdown is opened w hen a Move causes a Battleﬁeld to becom e Contested w hile it has no Units present from any player other than those that just m oved. 430. Units m ay cause Com bat w hen they Move. 430.1. A Com bat is triggered w hen a Move causes a Battleﬁeld to becom e Contested and Units controlled by opposing players. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 431. W hen a Move action is com plete, perform a Cleanup. 432. Recalls 433. A Recall is w hen a Perm anent is relocated from anyw here to its Base w ithout it being a Move. 434. Recalls are not Moves. 434.1. They do not cause Triggered Abilities to trigger that are triggered by Move actions. 434.2. A Recall causes a Perm anent to change locations. 434.3. A Recall cannot be prevented by actions and Gam e Effects that restrict or block Movem ent. 435. Gear can be Recalled. 435.1. W hen an un-attached Gear is created or played at a battleﬁeld, or is at a battleﬁeld for any other reason, it is Recalled to its controller's base during the next Cleanup. Example: An Equipment is attached to a unit at a battleﬁeld, so the Equipment is present at that battleﬁeld. If the unit dies, the Equipment will be recalled during the next cleanup. 436. Recalls do not affect the state of the Perm anent being recalled. 436.1. Unless otherw ise stated by the source of the Recall , D am age, Exhausted Status, Buffed Status, and applied Layer alterations w ill all rem ain unaffected by a Recall . 437. Com bat 438. A Com bat occurs w hen a Cleanup occurs, there are no item s on the Chain , and a Battleﬁeld has Units controlled by two opposing players. 439. Com bat is considered Staged if there are units controlled by tw o opposing players at a Battleﬁeld but the Steps of Com bat have not been initiated. 439.1. If m ore than one Battleﬁeld has Units controlled by opposing players at it at the sam e tim e, the Turn Player decides w hich Com bat to resolve ﬁrst. 439.2. If Staged Com bats stop being Staged before the Steps of Com bat are initiated, they are not resolved or executed. 440. Com bat can only occur betw een Units controlled by exactly tw o players. 440.1. In Modes of Play w ith m ore than tw o players, Battleﬁelds w ith Staged Com bats or Com bats in Progress are Invalid Destinations for Moves of all kinds ( Standard Moves or otherw ise) by Units controlled by Players w ho don't already have Units at that Battleﬁeld. See rule 425.2.a. for more information on Invalid Destinations. 440.2. In Modes of Play w ith m ore than tw o players, Battleﬁelds w ith Staged Com bats or Com bats in Progress are Invalid to be chosen as a location to play one or m ore Units by a player not involved in that Com bat by any m eans, 440.2.a. If an effect w ould require a Unit be played to a Battleﬁeld w ith a Staged Com bat or a Com bat in Progress , w here the controller of the played unit is not a participant, instead the Unit is played to its controller's Base. 440.2.b. Any subsequent reference to "here" in the corresponding effect is reassigned to the Controller's Base , w here the Unit w as played. Any further effects that m ay be invalidated are invalidated as if the effect w as m istargeted. See rule 352.5. Targeting for more information on Mistargeting. 440.3. All choices that w ould result in a Com bat occurring betw een m ore than tw o players sim ultaneously are invalid and ineligible to be com pleted. 441. The Steps of Com bat 442. Step 1: The Showdown Step 442.1. A Showdown opens at this tim e. 442.1.a. Establish w ho is Attacker and w ho is Defender. 442.1.a.1. The Attacker is the player w hose unit(s) applied the Contested status to the Battleﬁeld. They gain the Attacker designation now . 442.1.a.1.a. This player gains Focus as this Show dow n begins. 442.1.a.2. The Defender is the player w ho did not apply the Contested status to the Battleﬁeld. They gain the Defender designation now . 442.1.a.3. Units at the Contested Battleﬁeld controlled by the Attacker gain the Attacker designation now . 442.1.a.3.a. If a Unit controlled by the Attacker becom es present at this Battleﬁeld after this m om ent, it w ill gain the Attacker designation during the Cleanup phase follow ing the action that caused it to becom e present 442.1.a.4. Units at the Contested Battleﬁeld controlled by the Defender gain the Defender designation now . 442.1.a.4.a. If a Unit controlled by the Defender becom es present at this Battleﬁeld after this m om ent it w ill gain the Defender designation during the Cleanup phase follow ing the action that caused it to becom e present 442.1.b. Finalize item s on the Initial Chain if establishing Attacker and Defender has caused Triggered Abilities to becom e Pending. 442.1.b.1. The Attacking player, w ho has Focus , places Triggered Abilities on the Chain ﬁrst, follow ed by all non- Defender players in Turn Order , follow ed by the Defending Player. 442.1.c. The State Closes if an Initial Chain w as created. 442.1.c.1. O therw ise the Showdown continues, w ith the State Open as norm al. 442.1.d. Players proceed w ith any play on the Chain as norm al. 442.1.e. Focus does not pass upon closure of the Initial Chain, if any. 443. Step 2: The Com bat Dam age Step 443.1. W hen the Showdown closes, Attackers and Defenders resolve Com bat Dam age at the Battleﬁeld that w as attacked, using their current Might. 443.1.a. The Com bat Dam age Step only occurs if both Attacking and Defending units rem ain at the location. 443.1.a.1. If neither Attacking Units nor Defending Units rem ain at this stage, the Com bat Dam age Step is skipped. 443.1.b. Sum the Might of all Attacking Units. 443.1.c. Sum the Might of all Defending Units. 443.1.d. Starting w ith the Attacker , each player assigns an am ount of dam age equal to their sum m ed Might am ong the other's Units. 443.1.d.1. Assigning Dam age is not Dealing Dam age. 443.1.d.1.a. W hen all Dam age is assigned, it w ill be Dealt sim ultaneously. These actions are not synonym ous. 443.1.d.2. Abilities or effects m ay inﬂuence the order in w hich dam age is assigned. Rem inder: Lethal Dam age is non-zero dam age equaling or exceeding the Might of a Unit. 443.1.d.3. Units m ust have lethal dam age assigned to them in full before dam age is assigned to a different Unit. Example: If a player has 5 dam age to distribute am ong four 3 M ight units, they m ay not choose to assign 2 dam age to one of the units and 1 dam age to each of the rem aining 3. They m ust assign at least 3 dam age to one, and the rem aining 2 to another. 443.1.d.4. Units cannot have m ore dam age assigned to them than the m inim um required to constitute lethal dam age unless no further units rem ain to have dam age assigned to them . 443.1.d.5. A player m ust obey all requirem ents and restrictions on dam age assignm ent if able. Example: A player is assigning dam age to the follow ing units: a unit w ith Tank ("I m ust be assigned com bat dam age ﬁrst."); Caitlyn, Patrolling ("I m ust be assigned com bat dam age last."); and another unit w ithout any abilities. That player m ust assign com bat dam age ﬁrst to the unit w ith Tank, then to the unit w ith no abilities, then to Caitlyn. 443.1.d.6. If m ultiple Units have abilities or effects that require a player to assign them dam age w ith the sam e priority, that player m ay assign dam age to those units in any order. Example: A player is assigning dam age to the follow ing units: tw o units w ith Tank ("I m ust be assigned com bat dam age ﬁrst.") and one unit w ith no abilities. That player chooses one of the units w ith Tank and assigns com bat dam age to it. Then they m ust assign any rem aining dam age ﬁrst to the other unit w ith Tank, then to the unit w ith no abilities. 443.1.d.7. If a Unit has one or m ore Abilities or effects applying to it that dem and it be assigned dam age in a speciﬁc w ay that is exclusionary, then the assigning player chooses only one of those abilities to apply w hen assigning dam age. Example: Caitlyn, Patrolling ("I m ust be assigned com bat dam age last.") has been given the Tank ability ("I m ust be assigned com bat dam age ﬁrst."). A player is assigning dam age to this Caitlyn w ith Tank and tw o units w ith no abilities. That player can’t fulﬁll both of Caitlyn’s dam age requirem ents, so they m ay choose to assign dam age to Caitlyn ﬁrst, fulﬁlling the Tank requirem ent, or last, fulﬁlling Caitlyn’s printed requirem ent. They can’t choose to apply dam age to Caitlyn in betw een the other tw o units, because that w ouldn’t fulﬁll either requirem ent. 443.1.d.8. If there is m ore than one unit in w hich this situation applies to, each unit is dealt w ith individually. The assigning player chooses w hich ability or effect applies, and then resolves the assignm ent. If this creates a situation w here now m ore than one unit m ust be assigned w ith the sam e priority, those units m ay be assigned dam age in any order as norm al w ithin that priority. Example: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling ("I must be assigned combat damage last.") have been given the Tank ability ("I must be assigned combat damage ﬁrst."). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns and one unit with no abilities could choose to fulﬁll both Caitlyns’ Tank requirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit. 443.1.d.9. If a unit cannot be dealt dam age, then no am ount of dam age can be considered lethal. Such a unit is exem pt from any considerations of m andatory assignm ent. Example: Kayn, Unleashed says “If I have moved twice this turn, I don't take damage.” While Kayn can’t take damage, it is ignored for the purposes of assigning lethal damage in combat. 443.1.e. D eal Dam age to each unit equal to the am ount assigned to it. 444. Step 3: The Resolution Step 444.1. 1. Perform a Com bat Cleanup. 444.1.a. Invoke a Com bat Special Cleanup. 444.1.a.1. Insert “2c. Heal all Units. ” 444.1.a.2. Insert “2d. Recall Attackers present at the Battleﬁeld if Defenders are still present.” See rule 432. Recalls for more information. 444.1.a.3. Insert “2e. Rem ove Attacker and D efender D esignation from all Units and Players. ” 444.2. 2. If no Show dow n or Com bat is staged at this location, the player w ith Units rem aining here Establishes Control . 444.2.a. Clear the Contested Status . 444.2.b. This results in a Conquer if that player has not yet scored that Battleﬁeld this turn. See rule 182. Control for more information on Control. See rule 446.1. for more information on Conquering. 444.2.c. This does not have to be the player that applied Contested to the Battleﬁeld. 444.2.d. If there are no Units rem aining here controlled by any player, the Battleﬁeld becom es Uncontrolled. 445. Scoring 446. A player Scores in one of tw o w ays: 446.1. Conquer: A player gains Control of a Battleﬁeld they did not yet Score this turn. 446.1.a. In Modes of Play w ith team m ates, Battleﬁelds under the Control of a team m ate during the Beginning Phase are also disqualiﬁed from being Scored through Conquer by any m eans. 446.1.b. A player w ill gain control of a Battleﬁeld after establishing Control by applying Contested ﬁrst. 446.2. Hold: A player m aintains Control of a Battleﬁeld during their Beginning Phase. 447. A player m ay only Score , from either m ethod, once per Battleﬁeld per turn. 448. W hen a player Scores , tw o things occur: 448.1. The player earns up to one Point , depending on their current score. 448.1.a. The Final Point has additional restrictions. 448.1.a.1. N otably, points earned from sources that are not Conquer or Hold are not beholden to these restrictions. 448.1.b. W hen a player tries to earn a Point through a Score , and their current Point Total is 1 point from the Victory Score of the Mode of Play , the follow ing occurs: 448.1.b.1. If the player has Scored through Hold , that player scores the Final Point. 448.1.b.2. If the player has Scored through a Conquer and has Scored every Battleﬁeld through either m ethod this turn, that player scores the Final Point . If the player has Scored through a Conquer and has not Scored every Battleﬁeld this turn, that player draw s a card. 448.2. Trigger Score abilities at the Battleﬁeld that Scored. 448.2.a. Conquer abilities trigger at a Battleﬁeld that w as Conquered. 448.2.b. Hold abilities trigger at a Battleﬁeld that w as Held. 448.2.c. These w ill only trigger w hen the Battleﬁeld is Scored; I.E. These cannot be triggered m ore than once per turn for a player. 449. W hen a player accrues Points equal to the Victory Score for their Mode of Play , they W in the Gam e im m ediately. 450. Layers 451. Layers are the m echanism in w hich Gam e Effects alter the Traits, Intrinsic Abilities, or other properties of Gam e Objects. 452. Layers are an organizational structure. 452.1. Layers only serve to structure the application and order that Gam e Effects apply to Gam e Objects to m aintain consistency. 453. The layers are applied repeatedly until all effects operating on objects have been applied once and no changes have been processed. 453.1. Layers are applied in sequence. Each effect in them is applied as soon as able, and only a single tim e across all sequences. 453.2. W hen a sequence of applications com pletes, recur the process, and evaluate each layer again applying any effects that m ay now be applicable. 453.3. The rem oval or disqualiﬁcation of an effect is separate from the application of the effect, but still can only be applied once. Example: Fiora, Victorious has printed M ight 4 and says “W hile I'm M ighty, I have D eﬂect, Ganking, and Shield.” If a player places a buff on Fiora, her M ight is increased in the Arithm etic layer, after the layer for Ability-Altering Effects. The Ability-Altering Effect layer is then re-checked and the abilities D eﬂect, Ganking, and Shield applied. Since each effect has been applied once and there are no other effects to apply, Fiora’s characteristics are ﬁnalized as 5 M ight w ith D eﬂect, Ganking, and Shield. W hile a buffed Fiora, Victorious is in com bat as a defender, an additional +1 M ight w ill be applied in the Arithm etic layer, giving her 6 M ight and the 3 keyw ords. Example: A buffed Fiora, Victorious is in com bat as a defender w hen her buff is rem oved. Reevaluating the layers in sequence, she no longer gains D eﬂect, Ganking, and Shield during the Ability-Altering Effect layer, so w hen the Arithm etic layer is evaluated, neither the buff (w hich is gone) nor Shield (w hich she no longer has) apply. She goes directly from 6 M ight w ith three keyw ords to 4 M ight w ith no keyw ords.. 454. Layers are applied in the follow ing order: 454.1. 1. Trait-Altering Effects 454.1.a. This layer deals w ith effects that grant, rem ove, or replace inherent traits of Gam e Objects. N am e Super Type Type Tags Controller Cost D om ain 454.1.a.1. Assignm ent of M ight is dealt w ith in this layer. Example: A spell reads "A unit's M ight becom es 4 this turn." The unit's M ight is set to 4 in this layer. 454.1.b. O ne Gam e Object becom ing a copy of another. 454.1.b.1. All Traits, including the Rules Text, replace or are added to those of the original Gam e Object as speciﬁed by the Gam e Effect directing the Copy. This is applied in this layer. 454.1.c. Effects for this layer can be identiﬁed by the phrase "becom e(s)", "give," "is," or "are" in the text. Example: A perm anent has the ability "O ther friendly units are Yordles." O ther friendly units gain the Yordle tag in this layer. 454.2. 2. Ability-Altering Effects 454.2.a. This layer deals w ith effects that grant, rem ove, or replace the abilities or rules text of Gam e Objects . Keyw ords Passive Abilities Appending rules text Rem oving rules text D uplicating Rules Text from one Gam e Object to another 454.2.b. Effects for this layer can be identiﬁed by the phrase "becom e(s)," "give," "lose(s)," "have," "has," "is," or "are" in the text. Example: A perm anent has the ability "O ther friendly units have [Vision]." O ther friendly units gain the Vision keyw ord in this layer. 454.2.c. Abilities of Effect Text of Attached cards are appended in this layer. 454.3. 3. Arithm etic 454.3.a. This layer deals w ith the m athem atics of increasing and decreasing the num eric values of the traits of Gam e Objects. M ight Energy Cost Pow er Cost 454.3.b. W hen an arithm etic effect has a lim itation that applies, it is lim ited at the tim e of its application, and is “rem em bered” at that lim ited level for the duration of its effect. This process is called “snapshotting.” Example: If an effect gives a unit “-4 [M ] to a m in of 1 until end of turn” choosing a unit w ith 2 [M ], then the effect w ill generate -1 [M ] until end of turn. 454.3.c. Might Bonuses of Attached cards are applied in this layer. 454.3.d. This layer applies arithm etic in the follow ing w ay. 454.3.d.1. 1. Increases 454.3.d.1.a. Positive values, or increases, to M ight are applied ﬁrst. 454.3.d.1.b If there is a restriction or lim itation to this increase, the lim itation is “snapshotted” for the duration of the effect. 454.3.d.2. 2. D ecreases 454.3.d.2.a. N egative values, or decreases, to M ight are applied last. 454.3.d.2.b. If there is a restriction or lim itation to this decrease, the lim itation is snapshotted for the duration of the effect. 455. If m ore than one effect applies to the sam e Gam e Object in the Sam e Layer , or to each other in the sam e layer, then both effects w ill apply but their order m ay be determ ined by Dependency. 455.1. A Dependency is established if: 455.1.a. Applying one of the effects alters the existence of the other; or 455.1.b. Applying one of the effects alters the num ber of objects the other effect can inﬂuence 455.1.c. Applying one of the effects alters the outcom e w hen applying the other non- determ inistically 456. To determ ine w hich effect Depends on another, determ ine w hich of the prior criteria applies, and then also w hich effect’s evaluation is altered by the sequence of applications. That effect is said to Depend on the other. 456.1. To resolve a dependency, the effects w ithin the sam e layer that created the dependency m ust be applied such that: 1. Identify w hich effect Depends on the other w ithin the Layer. 2. Apply the effect that is depended on ﬁrst. 3. Im m ediately apply the effect that D epends on the ﬁrst effect next. 457. If m ore than one effect applies in the sam e layer but no dependency is established, then Tim estam p order is applied to the effects w ithin that layer and sublayer 457.1. W hen an effect begins applying, it establishes a tim e for w hich it is com pared against other Gam e Effects for purposes of resolving Layered effects as its Tim estam p. 457.1.a. Tim estam ps are not rote values. 457.1.b. Tim estam ps are relative com parisons betw een effects and w hen they began applying to the gam e. 457.1.c. Tim estam ps are not referenced by Gam e Effects in any w ay. They are only used to ﬁnalize layered effects. 457.2. W hen Rules Text becom es Inactive for any reason, it loses its Tim estam p. W hen it ceases to be Inactive, a new Tim estam p is established. 457.3. Effects are applied such that the earliest Tim estam p w ithin each Layer and Sublayer applies ﬁrst, follow ed by other Effects in that Layer and Sublayer in chronological order. 458.

Revealing Cards is still a gam e action and cannot be done unless instructed. See rule 411. Reveal for more information. 466.8.f. The Final Point has an adjustm ent to the criteria w hen scoring. 466.8.f.1. W hen scoring the Final Point from Conquer , a player m ust Score each Battleﬁeld in the sam e turn, excepting any that w ere occupied by their ally during that turn’s Beginning Phase . 466.8.f.2. N o other changes to Final Point restrictions. 466.8.g. Team m ates m ay not utilize the sam e Cham pion Legend . 466.8.h. Team m ates m ay not utilize the sam e Battleﬁelds . 649. Conceding 650. A player m ay concede at any tim e. 651. W hen a player concedes, they are rem oved from the gam e in progress. 651.1. If only one other player is rem aining after a player has conceded, the player rem aining W ins. 651.2. If m ore than one player rem ains after a concession, follow the steps for the Rem oval of a Player. 651.3. Rem oval of a player involves them no longer being able to m ake choices or otherw ise inﬂuence the gam e. 651.4. If the player has Team m ates due to the Mode of Play , that player’s Team m ates also lose and are rem oved from the gam e. 652.

Rem ove the Battleﬁeld they contributed to the gam e if it is in use. 652.2.a. If it w as in use, replace it w ith a token battleﬁeld w ith no abilities. 652.2.b. Any units or hidden cards there do not m ove and are otherw ise unaffected by this process. 652.2.c. If the rem oved battleﬁeld w as applying any continuous effects, those continuous effects im m ediately cease, w hich m ay cause changes in the characteristics of units or hidden cards there. Example: A battleﬁeld reads "Units here have +1 [M ]." If that battleﬁeld's ow ner concedes and the battleﬁeld is rem oved from the gam e as a result, units there im m ediately cease to get +1 [M ]. 652.3. Rem ove all cards they ow n from the gam e. 652.4. Counter all spells and abilities of all types controlled by the player that has conceded. 652.5. Proceed w ith the gam e. 652.5.a. Turn 652.5.a.1.

Com bat is resolved or a Cleanup is com pleted. 652.5.c. Priority 652.5.c.1. If the rem oved player had Priority during a Chain , the next Player in order receives Priority . 652.5.c.2. If the player being rem oved creates a state w here all Players have passed Priority , then the m ost recent spell or ability on the Chain w ill resolve w ith Priority being re-established as appropriate for the state after the resolution of that spell or ability. 700. Additional Rules 701. Buffs 702. Buffs are objects placed on Units. 702.1. Buffs can be tracked w ith a buff rem inder card from a Riftbound booster pack or w ith any spare object in your surroundings. 702.2. Buffs can be added or spent. 702.2.a. To Buff a Unit , a player chooses a Unit and then places a buff on it. That Unit is Buffed for as long as the buff rem ains on it. 702.2.b. Spending a Buff rem oves a single Buff counter from a Unit . 702.2.b.1. A buff cannot be spent from a Unit that does not have a buff. 702.2.b.2. A player can only spend buffs on units they control. 702.3. There can only be one Buff on a Unit at a tim e. 702.3.a. If a Buff is added, or instructed to be added, on a Unit that already has a Buff , it is not placed instead. 703. Each Buff individually contributes +1 Might to a Unit. 704. Buffs are Gam e Objects and m ay be referenced, counted, or targeted by other effects as speciﬁed. 705. If a Unit leaves play, rem ove all Buffs from it. 705.1. Cham pions do not retain Buffs in the Cham pion Zone, even if they return there som ehow . 706. Mighty 707. Mighty is a description that applies to som e units. O ther gam e effects can check w hether a unit is Mighty. 708. A Unit "is M ighty" as long as its M ight is 5 or greater. 709. A Unit "becom es M ighty" at the m om ent its M ight changes from being less than 5 to being 5 or greater. Example: A Unit w ith M ight 4 that gets +1 [M ] becom es Mighty . Example: A Unit w ith M ight 5 that gets +1 [M ] does not becom e Mighty , because it w as already Mighty. 710. Units on the board are evaluated according to their current M ight. Example: A unit w ith a base M ight of 3 is targeted by a spell that reads "A unit gets +3 [M ] this turn." As that spell resolves, its M ight changes from 3 to 6, and it becom es Mighty . W hen that effect expires at the end of the turn, it w ill no longer be Mighty. 711. Units in Non-Board Zones are evaluated according to their inherent M ight. Example: A unit in the trash is Mighty if its printed M ight is 5 or greater. It doesn't m atter if there w ere effects raising or low ering its m ight w hile it w as on the board. 712. Bonus Dam age 713. Bonus Dam age is an intrinsic property that can be granted to Deal actions that inﬂuence the am ount of Dam age that the action is distributing. 714. If m ore than one instance of Bonus Dam age is applied or granted to a Deal action, all instances are sum m ed and applied once. 714.1. Bonus D am age can only be a positive value, and can only increase the am ount of Dam age being distributed. 714.2. If, for any reason, Bonus Dam age w ould be a negative num ber, then no Bonus Dam age is applied to the action. 715. Bonus D am age applies to the total dam age Dealt by one instance of the action. 715.1. If the Deal action has a single target, the am ount of Dam age to that target w ill be increased by the Bonus Dam age granted to it. 715.2. If the Deal action has m ultiple targets, the am ount of Dam age dealt to each target is increased by Bonus Dam age individually and separately. Example: Singularity is a spell that says “D eal 6 to each of up to tw o units.” A player plays Singularity w hile they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says “Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus D am age.” Singularity deals 1 Bonus D am age to both of its targets, dealing 7 to each. 715.3. If the Deal action Splits dam age, then the Bonus Dam age applies to the am ount of Dam age that w ill be Split . This can alter the num ber of targets eligible to be chosen. Example: Volibear, Furious is a unit that says in part “W hen I attack, deal 5 dam age split am ong any num ber of enem y units here.” A player attacks w ith Volibear, Furious w hile they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says “Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus D am age.” Volibear, Furious now deals 6 dam age split am ong any num ber of enem y units at its location, and can choose to split that dam age am ong up to 6 units rather than the usual 5. 716. Attachm ent 717. Attaching is a lim ited action that causes cards to becom e linked to each other to com bine their effects in som e w ay. This causes one card to becom e Attached and the other to becom e A Top-Most Card. See rule 421 Attach for more information. 718. Attached is the state of a card being linked to another card in this w ay. 718.1. A card rem ains in this state until Detached. 718.2. W hile in this state, the card’s Rules Text is Inactive. See rule 720 Inactive for more information. 718.3. W hile in this state, Abilities in the card’s Effect Text are appended to the Rules Text of the Top-Most Card. 718.4. W hile in this state, the card’s Might Bonus m odulates the Top-Most Card ’s Might by the value listed. 718.5. Attached cards still have all properties of being a card on the board w hile in this state. 718.5.a. Attached cards still have all Types and Tags w hile Attached. 718.5.b. Attached cards still can be chosen or targeted by gam e effects w hile Attached. 718.6. Attached cards cannot be m oved separately from the Top-Most Card they are Attached to. 718.7. A card m ay be Attached only to a single Top-Most card at a tim e. 718.8. Attached cards m ay have different Controllers from their Top-Most card. 718.8.a. Changes in Control of the Top-Most card do not im pact Control of Attached cards and vice versa. 718.8.b. An Attached card still appends the abilities in its Effect Text to the Rules Text of the Top-Most card and m odulates the Top-Most Card ’s Might by its Might Bonus. 719. A Top-Most Card is a card that has one or m ore cards linked to it through the process of Attaching. 719.1. The Effect Text of all cards Attached to this card are appended to the Rules Text of this card for as long as they rem ain Attached. 719.2. This card ceases being a Top-Most Card w hen there are no longer any cards Attached to it. 719.3. A Top-Most Card and all cards Attached to it are at the sam e location. 719.3.a. W hen the Top-Most Card m oves, all Attached cards m ove w ith it. 719.4. The Exhausted and Ready state of the Top-Most card does not affect nor change the status of the Attached cards and vice versa. 719.5. W hen a Top-Most Card changes zones from a board zone to a non-board zone, all Attached cards Detach from it, rem aining in their current zones. 719.5.a. The player that controls the Top-Most Card that changed zones decides the order these cards Detach in, and thus the order of any relevant effects that occur due to the Detach occurring. 720. Inactive 721.1. Card text can occasionally be assigned to be ignored, disregarded, or otherw ise rendered as not applicable during the course of play. This state is referred to as Inactive. 721.1.a. Text m arked this w ay is not applied at all w hile in this state. 721.1.b. Inactive Abilities do not trigger, do not apply, and cannot be activated. Inactive instructions are not processed. 722. Inactive text is still present on cards. 722.1. Cards w ith Inactive text still have keyw ords for the sake of Gam e Effects that w ant to reference or see if a card has a keyw ord. 722.2. Gam e Effects that parse or interpret text to determ ine target eligibility m ay still parse Inactive text for the sake of eligibility. Example: Spinning Axe is a gear with [Temporary]. While it’s attached and its rules text is inactive, its [Temporary] ability doesn’t trigger. However, a spell that reads “Destroy a gear with [Temporary]” could still choose and destroy Spinning Axe. 723. Rules Text is never Inactive by default. 724. Effect Text is Inactive unless the card w ith the Effect Text is Attached. 725. Inactive text can partially cease to be Inactive under speciﬁc circum stances and exceptions. 725.1. If an Attached card has a Passive or Replacem ent ability that applies during the process of Attaching or a Triggered ability that triggers off of Attaching , that text exists and can be processed as it Attaches. 725.2. If an Attached card has a Passive or Replacem ent ability that applies during the process of Detaching or a Triggered ability that triggers off of Detaching , that text exists and can be processed as it Detaches. 725.3. If an Attached card has an Equip ability, the W eaponm aster keyw ord can reference that Equip ability and any abilities that passively m odify that Equip ability. 726. Keywords 727. A Keyword is a speciﬁc term that appears on Cards that acts as a shorthand for a speciﬁc gam e effect, or ability of any variety. 727.1. A Keyword can be an ability. 727.2. Keywords can be identiﬁed by having a colored highlight behind them . 727.2.a. The color of the highlight has no effect on gam eplay. 727.3. Keywords can be referenced or speciﬁed by other Gam e Effects. 727.3.a. O ther effects m ay grant Keywords. 727.3.a.1. The deﬁnition and rules of the speciﬁc Keyword w ill determ ine the behavior if a Keyword is granted w hile it is already present. 727.3.a.2. The effect that granted the Keyword w ill specify the duration for w hich it is granted. 727.3.a.3. If an effect that grants a Keyword does not specify a duration, the duration is as long as that Gam e Object rem ains on the Board or in its current Non-Board Zone. 727.3.b. O ther effects m ay rem ove Keywords. 727.3.b.1. The effect that rem oved the Keyword w ill specify the duration it is rem oved. 727.3.b.2. If an effect that rem oves a Keyword does not specify a duration, the duration is as long as that Gam e Object rem ains on the Board or in its current Non-Board Zone. 728. A card can have any num ber of Keywords. 729. Sim ilar to other rules text, execute any effects of Keywords in the order listed w hen reading the card from top to bottom of the rules text. 730. Keyw ord Glossary 731. Accelerate 731.1. Accelerate is a Unit ability. 731.1.a. Accelerate is functionally short for "As you play m e, you m ay pay [1] and 1 Pow er as an additional cost. If you do, I enter ready." 731.1.a.1. If the unit has a single dom ain, the Pow er portion of the Accelerate cost can be paid only w ith a Pow er that m atches the dom ain of the unit. 731.1.a.2. If the unit has no dom ain or m ore than one dom ain, the Pow er portion of the Accelerate cost can be paid w ith [A] (a Pow er of any dom ain). 731.2. Accelerate is an Optional Additional Cost to be paid as a player plays the unit w ith the ability. 731.2.a. Accelerate costs cannot be paid w hile the unit is on the board, only as part of the steps of playing a card. 731.3. Accelerate has no function w hile on the board. 731.4. M ultiple instances of Accelerate are redundant. 731.5. Accelerate, and w hether or not a unit has Accelerate, is a characteristic of the Unit and m ay be checked or referenced by other Gam e Effects. 731.6. Accelerate inﬂuences the state of the unit entering the Board. It does not enter exhausted and then becom e ready. 731.6.a. Accelerate w ill not interact w ith, or trigger, abilities that are affected by units becom ing ready. 732. Action 732.1. Action is a Perm issive keyw ord. 732.1.a. It can be present on Spells , Units , Rune Abilities, Legend Abilities or Perm anent Abilities. 732.1.b. Action grants the corresponding card or effect perm ission to be played or activated during Showdowns, even w hen it is not the Controlling player's turn. 732.1.c. Action is functionally short for the follow ing: 732.1.c.1. O n Spells and Units: "This can be played during show dow ns on any player's turn." 732.1.c.2. O n Rune, Legend, or Perm anent Abilities: "This can be activated during show dow ns on any player's turn." 732.2. The card or effect w ith this keyw ord is not restricted to show dow ns. This perm ission is inclusive of all other tim ings and options available to the ability as w ritten or by default. 732.3. Action does not alter the function of any instruction of the corresponding card or effect it is on. It is only perm ission. Example: Playing a Unit w ith Action still has the inherent restrictions of playing Units w ithout Action. It can only be played to the controlling player's base or a battleﬁeld they control. 732.4. Action is a referenceable characteristic. 732.4.a. W hether or not a Gam e Object has Action is a characteristic of that Gam e Object and m ay be checked or referenced by other Gam e Effects. 732.4.b. W hether or not a Spell has Action is a characteristic of that Spell and m ay be checked or referenced by other Gam e Effects. 732.4.c.
